import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd

# Data loading and preprocessing
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# ... preprocessing steps ...
X, y = preprocess(data)

# Model definition
model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')

# Training
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
# Evaluation
scores = model.evaluate(X, y)
print("Accuracy:", scores[1])

## Slide 11: Fine-Tuning, Transfer Learning, LoRA
**Content:**
- **Transfer Learning:**
  - Adapting pretrained models (e.g., BERT, ResNet) for new tasks with less data.
  - Common in computer vision (ImageNet models) and NLP.
- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - Continue training a pretrained model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset.
  - Adjust learning rates, freeze/unfreeze layers.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
  - Efficient fine-tuning by injecting low-rank matrices into model weights.
  - Lowers computational requirements, ideal for large language models.
  - [LORA PAPER]([https://link-url-here.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685))

**Explanation:**
- Use a pretrained NLP model and fine-tune on domain-specific data using LoRA for efficiency.

**Pseudo-code Example:**
```python
# Pseudo-code illustrating LoRA adaptation
model = load_pretrained_model('gpt2')
apply_lora(model, rank=4)
model.train(custom_data)
```
** Modular Example **
preprocess.py
``` python
import pandas as pd

def load_and_preprocess(filepath):
    data = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    # ... preprocessing steps ...
    X, y = preprocess(data)
    return X, y
```
model.py
``` python
import tensorflow as tf

def create_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy')
    return model
```

train.py
``` python
from preprocess import load_and_preprocess
from model import create_model

X, y = load_and_preprocess('data.csv')
model = create_model()
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10)
scores = model.evaluate(X, y)
print("Accuracy:", scores[1])
```

## Slide 11: Fine-Tuning, Transfer Learning, LoRA
**Content:**
- **Transfer Learning:**
  - Adapting pretrained models (e.g., BERT, ResNet) for new tasks with less data.
  - Common in computer vision (ImageNet models) and NLP.
- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - Continue training a pretrained model on a smaller, domain-specific dataset.
  - Adjust learning rates, freeze/unfreeze layers.
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):**
  - Efficient fine-tuning by injecting low-rank matrices into model weights.
  - Lowers computational requirements, ideal for large language models.

**Explanation:**
- Use a pretrained NLP model and fine-tune on domain-specific data using LoRA for efficiency.

**Actual Code Example Using Hugging Face and PEFT:**
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

# Load a pretrained model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Define LoRA configuration
config = LoraConfig(
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",  # task type can vary based on use-case
    inference_mode=False,   # set to True for inference-only mode
    r=4,                    # low-rank dimension
    lora_alpha=32,          # scaling factor
    lora_dropout=0.1        # dropout probability for LoRA layers
)

# Apply LoRA to the model
model = get_peft_model(model, config)

# Now the model is ready for fine-tuning on custom data
# Example: model.train() with a custom dataset...
```

## Slide 12: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Vector Databases
**Overview:**
- **RAG Concept:** Combines document retrieval with language generation to produce context-aware and informative responses by integrating external knowledge into the generation process.

**Simple RAG Approach:**
- **Basic Retrieval Methods:**
  - Uses straightforward techniques like keyword-based search or basic vector similarity (e.g., TF-IDF, cosine similarity with precomputed embeddings).
  - Retrieves documents or text passages that match the query.
- **Generation:**
  - The retrieved context is fed into the generative model to guide its response, without deep semantic understanding or advanced filtering.

**Advanced RAG Techniques:**
- **Semantic Search:**
  - Employs transformer-based embeddings to understand the deeper meaning of queries, beyond simple keyword matching.
- **Re-ranking:**
  - Reorders initial results based on contextual relevance and coherence.
- **Contextual Understanding:**
  - Incorporates conversation history and multi-turn context.
  - Uses structured reasoning frameworks (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts) for complex queries.
- **Benefits Over Simple RAG:**
  - More accurate, contextually appropriate retrieval of information.
  - Enhanced generation aligning better with user intent.

**Vector Databases:**
- **Purpose:** Efficiently store and search embeddings for fast similarity lookups (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone).
- **Role in RAG:** Support both simple and advanced RAG through scalable, responsive retrieval.

**LangChain Example:**
```python
from langchain import RetrievalQA
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Assume documents loaded in `docs`
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_texts([doc.page_content for doc in docs], embeddings)

qa = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=model, retriever=vector_store.as_retriever())
response = qa.run("How can I detect phishing emails?")
print(response)
```

## Slide 13: Tool Binding & Structured Output
**Concept:**
- **Tool Binding:** Integrating specialized functions (tools) with language models to handle specific tasks.
- **Structured Output:** Using schemas (e.g., with Pydantic) to enforce consistent, validated responses from these tools.

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** Ensures outputs follow a predefined structure.
- **Validation:** Guarantees data types and formats via Pydantic models.
- **Integration:** Seamless incorporation of LLM results into downstream processes.

**Example Using LangChain & Pydantic:**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType, Tool

# Define a Pydantic model for structured email analysis output
class EmailAnalysis(BaseModel):
    subject: str
    is_complaint: bool

# Tool function that returns structured data
def analyze_email(email_text: str) -> EmailAnalysis:
    # Here, you'd typically call an LLM or analysis function
    # For demonstration, return a dummy structured output
    return EmailAnalysis(subject="Service Delay", is_complaint=True)

# Create a LangChain tool with the function
email_tool = Tool(
    name="EmailAnalyzer",
    func=analyze_email,
    description="Analyzes email text to determine if it is a complaint."
)

# Initialize an LLM and an agent that uses the tool
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[email_tool],
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION
)

# Run the agent with an email analysis request
result = agent.run("Please analyze the following email: I'm frustrated with the service delays.")
print(result)
```

## Slide 14: LLM Integration & Deployment (Plotly, Model Serving)
